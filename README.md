working and tutorials of the program -
1. firstly you will asked to enter the elements in the array in which you want to make groups 

2. Enter 000 in the input to go to get out of the array inputting loop

3. you can easily enter numbers in a range like from 2 to 20 by just simply inputting the 2-20 in the input section and the program will automatically create a array having elements from 2 to 20

4. max number of elements supported are 99999 which is quiet large - just keep in mind while putting values in range about this 

5. after the sucessfull input of the elements you will asked the number of groups required and desired number of members in each group 

6. after that the groups with their respective members will be showm which have a option to print to a txt file which will be created at the desktop
